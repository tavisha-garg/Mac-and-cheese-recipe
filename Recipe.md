 STEP 1 - Take a large pot. Add in some water and salt to it and bring it to a boil. Cook the elbow macaroni in the boiling water and stir occasionally for about 7-8 mins until cooked. Drain it. 

Now for preparing the sauce- 
 STEP 2 - Take a saucepan, melt the butter in it. Let it melt completely over medium heat. 
 STEP 3 - Add 2-3 tablespoons of all purpose flour along with salt and black pepper to it and make a smooth mixture. 
 STEP 4 - Now slowly start pouring milk into the mixture and stir continuously. 
 STEP 5 - Let it boil for about 2-3 minutes until smooth and bubbly. After that, add all the cheese and stir properly. 
 STEP 6 - Let it cook on low heat until the cheese is melted and sauce is a little thick. 
 STEP 7 - Add in all the remaining seasonings according to your taste. Stir well.
 STEP 8 - Add in the boiled macaroni and stir. Let it cook on low heat for 5 mins and your mac and cheese is ready.  
 STEP 9 - Serve hot. 


NOTE - 1) Do not overcook the macaroni or else it will become mushy. 
       2) Continuously stir the mixture while adding milk in it so that it doesn't form any lumps in it. 
       3) Keep an eye on the milk-butter-flour mixture when kept for boiling as milk boils fast and burns easily.
